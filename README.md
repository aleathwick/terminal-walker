Simple markov chain simulation in python

This repo contains a notebook with some code for simulating discrete or continuous markov chains. This was partly out of personal interest - by generating millions of samples, simulation can answer interesting questions about the behaviour and distribution of states of markov chains. Partly it was also out of practical need, to aid my studies - simulation is very useful for verifying results found by pen and paper.
